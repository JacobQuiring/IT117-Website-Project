# IT117-Website-Project
The final project for my IT117 class at Purdue University Global was to be a website for a restaurant with 7 pages, some required, such as the index and menu, others for filler, such as the history and chef pages. 
I don't claim to be an artist, so it's color scheme is a bit of an eye sore, though it looked good enough to me at the time. My primary focus in this project was practicing with HTML and CSS.
