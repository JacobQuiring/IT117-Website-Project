			<p>Jake's Breakfast, Lunch, &#38; Diner was started in 1973 as a reminder of &#34;the Good Ol' Days&#34;, where folks could get breakfast with their old friends, share lunch with a date, and have dinner with the family. We offer a traditional American style of dining through cuisines such as burgers and sandwiches, steaks, and salads, for lunch and dinner, and waffles, pancakes, bacon &#38; eggs, and more steak for breakfast. On top of that, we offer YOU the opportunity to request your favorite American foods for our monthly specials, which you can enjoy while listening to some live music or laughing along to an open mic performance. Come have pancakes over a reunion, ask that pretty girl out for a burger at a place you know she will love, bring your spouse and kids for a raucous dinner over some of the best steaks!</p>
			<p>Our goal with this setting is to present a place where locals and visitors alike can enjoy something old and something new all in the same place. We want to support local talentby inviting them to make music or jokes in front of friends, family, and passersby. We also pursue an arrangement of dishes loved by our community by offering them the chance to input their ideas and preferred dishes to our menu. It is our dream to be a light to the traveler and a tradition to our neighbors. It is our hope to become a slice of home to all.</p>
